# Performance Metrics to measure Machine Learning Models
Performance Metrics implementations from scratch without using sklearn to evaluate machine learning models.
These metrics will help us understand how well our model is performing.

Performance metrics computed for the  data 5_a.csv
1. Confusion Matrix 
2. F1 Score 
3. AUC Score
4. Accuracy Score

Performance metrics computed for the  data 5_b.csv
1. Confusion Matrix 
2. F1 Score 
3. AUC Score
4. Accuracy Score

Performance metrics computed for the  data 5_c.csv
1. Best threshold of probability

Performance metrics computed for the  data 5_d.csv
1. Mean Square Error 
2. MAPE
3. R^2 error
